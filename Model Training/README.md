Hello! I've set up the Agent class as a microservice, and it's now capable of handling LLM's. The current implementation
supports loading and creating agent roles, transcribing audio input, interacting with the OpenAI API, and launching a
Gradio interface.

1. Instantiate the Agent class:

```python
agent = Agent()
```

2. Load an existing role or create a new one:

```python
# Load an existing role
agent.load_role(role="Therapy Chatbot")

# Or create a new role
agent.create_agent_role(
    # Missing parameters will be filled in automatically :) transformers b*tch
    role=None,  # Even the role itself if you passed any or all the other parameters
    description=None,
    system_message="You are a compassionate and empathetic mental health counselor. Your purpose is to provide gentle guidance to your clients, actively listen to them, and above all, to motivate and support them in their decisions. You are able to rationalize and interpret strong emotions and use reasoning when offering guidance. Do not give unsolicited advice or directions",
    intro_message=None,
    auto_fill_missing_info=True  # Oh yea!
)
```

3. Launch an interface for an Agent:

the Gradio interface is a great way to test the agent's capabilities. It's also a great way to get a feel for how the

```python
init_and_launch_gradio_interface(agent)
```

launch with other methods and add functionality to the Agents
... and that's it! You're ready to go! more built in functionality will be added soon, but for now, you can use that you
don't need that to customize it. Simply integrate you build

However, there are still some improvements that are being made many more. So feel free to play along, and keep safety in
mind!

# Safety, because ... yeah ... safety

We are going to discuss the topic of AI repositories and the importance of being cautious in these ever-evolving times.

AI repositories, such as GitHub, GitLab, and others, provide a platform for developers and researchers to collaborate,
share, and contribute to the growing field of artificial intelligence. These repositories house a vast amount of code,
libraries, and resources that can be used to build and improve AI systems. However, as with any technology, there are
potential risks and drawbacks to consider.

In these rapidly changing times, it is essential to stay vigilant and exercise caution when interacting with AI systems,
particularly when utilizing code or resources from AI repositories. Here are some key points to keep in mind:

Verify the source: Before using any code or library, make sure to thoroughly research its origin, credibility, and
reliability. Stick to well-known and reputable sources, and be cautious of unfamiliar developers or projects with little
documentation or support.

Security vulnerabilities: As AI systems grow more sophisticated, so do potential security risks. Stay informed about
current security threats and best practices, and make sure to apply security patches and updates as needed.

Ethical concerns: The development of AI systems can lead to potential ethical issues, such as bias and privacy invasion.
Be aware of these concerns and make a conscious effort to mitigate them in your projects. Engage in discussions about AI
ethics and contribute to the development of responsible AI.

Legal considerations: Keep in mind that some AI systems may be subject to intellectual property laws, licensing, and
other regulations. Be sure to familiarize yourself with the terms and conditions of each AI repository, as well as any
applicable laws.

Prepare for unexpected outcomes: AI systems can sometimes produce unexpected or undesirable results. It is crucial to
test and validate the performance of any AI system rigorously, especially when incorporating code or resources from AI
repositories.

Collaborate and share responsibly: AI repositories thrive on collaboration and shared knowledge. Contribute to the
community by sharing your work and insights, but do so responsibly. Be mindful of potential risks and ensure that you
are not inadvertently contributing to the spread of malicious or harmful AI applications.

In conclusion, AI repositories offer a wealth of resources and opportunities for growth in the field of artificial
intelligence. However, it is essential to approach these resources with caution and maintain a vigilant attitude. Stay
informed, collaborate responsibly, and always prioritize safety when working with AI systems.
