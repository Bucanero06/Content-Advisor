# Summary to early collaborators and contributors of the project: "Content Advisor"
For the Content Advisor project, I recommend a microservices architecture to ensure modularity, readability, and maintainability of the codebase. The primary target is the integration of GPT-4 technology for content analysis, with the development of modules for different data types and industries. This will enable us to provide real-time support for various industries and empower users with data-driven insights and personalized guidance.

To achieve our goals and vision, we need to implement continuous integration and testing for a robust application. We should also develop additional input models, such as finBERT, speech-to-text, live streams, podcasts, etc. This will allow us to expand our capabilities and cater to a wider range of users.

We should also rename the repository to a more general name to reflect the broad scope of the project. Additionally, we need to implement YouTube chapters extraction, context extraction, and embedding generation, and adapt the existing transcription process and OpenAI API query for chapter-based content.

To ensure the application's quality, we must set up a continuous integration (CI) pipeline for automated testing and deployment. This will help us catch and fix issues early in the development process.

Regarding collaboration instructions, we should follow common Git practices and avoid deleting the work of others. Instead, we should contribute in modules and create a pull request. Most help is appreciated for continuous integration and testing (CI/CD) and documentation.

Overall, the Content Advisor project has the potential to revolutionize content analysis and assistance. By leveraging GPT-4 technology and implementing a microservices architecture, we can create an advanced content analysis tool that contributes to the advancement of AI technology and its positive impact on society.

YouTube chapters extraction:
Implement a function to extract YouTube chapters (timestamps and titles) from the video description or metadata.
If the chapters are not available, consider implementing an alternative method, such as using an NLP model to detect
topic changes in the transcription.

Adapt the existing transcription process:
Modify the current transcription process to work with YouTube chapters. Transcribe each chapter separately and store the
transcriptions in a structured format, such as a dictionary or a DataFrame, with chapter information.

Chapter-based context extraction:
Develop a function to extract context from each chapter separately. This function should be able to identify questions
within chapters and extract relevant context for each question.

Embedding generation for chapters:
Modify the existing embedding generation process to work with the chapter-based context. Generate embeddings for each
question's context within the chapters.

Training data preparation:
Combine the chapter-based context and embeddings into a single dataset suitable for training a model. Ensure that the
data format is consistent with the input requirements of the target model.

Update the OpenAI API query:
Modify the existing API query function to work with chapter-based context and embeddings. Ensure that the model can
effectively answer questions based on the context from the YouTube chapters.

Documentation and code refactoring:
Update the existing documentation to include the new functionality related to YouTube chapters. Make sure to provide
clear instructions on how to use the new module.
Refactor the code to ensure modularity, readability, and maintainability. Separate the chapter-based functionality into
a dedicated module or class, if necessary.

Testing and continuous integration:
Implement unit tests and integration tests to ensure the proper functioning of the new module and its compatibility with
the existing codebase.
Set up a continuous integration (CI) pipeline to automate the testing and deployment process, ensuring that any new
changes do not break existing functionality.

The current name of the repo is "Financial Advisor" but it should be changed to something more general, thats just the
current example to get us started
I'll be opening issues for these and posting collaboration instructions soon, feel free at the assist in any way you
can, simply remember to create a new fork and follow common git practices for the time being. DO-NOT delete works
of others!!! instead contribute in modules and create a pull request.
Microservices (use of modules, classes, endpoints) is the way to go.
Most help appreciated for continuous integration and testing (CI/CD) and documentation.

- suggestions of better context for the question
- use pretrained models for a more robust solution both for the embeddings and the completions
- move from script to a web app
- add description of channel, etc... in the prompt
- add a way to add more context to the prompt in a more interactive way like a conversation
- sort the context by similarity and recentness, search web for more context
- relies on data preparation modules which should be chosen based on the data type itself
    - Input Models
        - youtube module
        - "finBERT" model for financial text classification and sentiment analysis of financial news
        - Read financial reports module (10-K, 10-Q, 8-K, etc...) and extract context using NLP
          (base models already exist)
        - google speech to text module
        - documentation reader module
        - live streams module
        - podcast module
        - books module
        - articles module
        - research papers module
    - Ensemble DB Schemes
        - Prompt engineering
        - Context choice
        - Tokenizer module
        - Context weighting for settings optimization and preparing any assisting data needed to answer the question
        - Question Engineering
    - Live Conversions
        - Live explaining/translation of stream
        - Live summarization of stream
        - Live question answering of stream
        - Live Actions based on stream
          Not all these require either usage of embeddings or completion models. Modularity and speed are key,
          although the latter is not a priority at the moment. Proof of concept and demo creation is the priority.
